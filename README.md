# Scratch-Extensions
This Website is currently under Development


This Website is has more Opportunity and Freedom when it comes to Customisation compared with the Currently Running one which uses Google Sites!\


This Website is not out yet because I want to add the Docs For the Extensions first,
Even perhaps adding new details in it in the process!

### Google Sites/Current Running One:
